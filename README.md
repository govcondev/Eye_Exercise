# Eye Exercise

## Project Description
This Eye Exercise is a project that uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create animated eyes that follow the user's cursor movements. Employing event handling and CSS animation techniques, this exercise offers an opportunity to hone your skills in web development and user interaction.
